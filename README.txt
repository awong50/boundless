Boundless Immortal "Earthshaker": 

In the [REDACTED], each world has a phrase, each system a law, each galaxy a code, and each universe a grand Dao. Over the course of 15 years, the one who would become known in legend as "Boundless Immortal" reached the pinnacle. Interpreting every phrase, the law they fell under, the code that represented them, and finally the tapestry of the Grand Dao took a damn while, but he was finally at the cusp of true, legitimate immortality. That, after all, was blocked by the Grand Dao itself. Yet despite it all, the Myriad Heavens and the Tenebrous Underworld chose to intervene at the most critical moment with their own two Grand Daos, damaging the Grand Dao of Boundless and leaving reality imperfected. Being a fucking badass, Boundless adapted on the spot, shifting the cosmos with two hands and crushing the opposition with another eight. After defeating the embodiments of the Myriad Heavens and the Tenebrous Underworld, he comprehended their Grand Dao. Over the course of a universal cycle, while constantly dealing with internal injuries (opponents on the cusp of ascension are real shitbags), he took the opportunity to weave together the Grand Daos in a way that would leave the three realities stronger for it, while also leaving room for growth. Kind of sucked ass cause he wasn't a lawyer or anything, but as the peerless talent in his universe he was up to the task. As the fabric of reality destabilized and the three universes were molded into one, Boundless embroidered the Grand Dao with the path of Expansion, allowing it to be further appended with new insights and allow the reality to develop further. Taking on the same insights into himself, he formed a perfected immortality and escaped the limits of eternity with a triple Grand Dao.
Now the odd thing is that Boundless felt the Grand Dao shifting infinitesimally every moment. With the way things were developing, that would result in a completely different Grand Dao at the end of a universal cycle as opposed to at the beginning of one. Naturally, he had no clue how to go about this because it was quite an absurd thing to have to account for. He looked a little further, found strings of Fate and Karma floating around, and got a little ticked off. So, he put that on hold for a little while.


But it doesn't stop there! You see, Boundless recognized from an early age that there was always a higher mountain to climb, so he looked around a little and found a bunch of universes floating around in the vast [REDACTED]. He tried entering one, but found out the hard way that the universes actually have their own wills too and notice things that occur on the same level of existence as them so... that was awkward. He decided that despite it all, he was still built different and he was going to drop a soul fragment into every universe he saw, and let it develop on its own to eventually reach the pinnacle again and reform the Grand Dao, adding it to his own path. Each soul fragment has its memories sealed before generating a corporeal body, in order to better acclimate to and understand the Grand Dao of their reality. As their understanding becomes greater, more memories of the home reality are restored, along with passing this new understanding of a reality along to the Boundless Immortal. He accidentally misplaced the first one and dropped it into the [REDACTED] causing it to turn into some fucking eldritch abomination that he washed his hands of and ignored. Managed to influence his Dao a bit and make things a bit more spicy, but hey, alls well that ends well. It's not like it could do anything harmful to him anyhow, with perfected immortality. But the rest of them landed just fine.
There is that rather odd one Soul Fragment 4 dropped into, having the Grand Dao of "Science" being accessible from living on a single planet in the vast cosmos. Getting the fragment there was a tight fit and ended up pissing off the [REDACTED] a bit, but each soul fragment still possesses his perfected immortality to it's not like it could do anything to him either. Well... it is a little weird how the fourth soul fragment's memories were revealed so quickly and the world shook so hard some species went extinct, but maybe Boundless was just being a little too rough. Temporal flux was twisted at the position of that universe causing things to take a while to develop, so in the meantime the Boundless Immortal went back to deciphering the correlation between the Grand Dao, the temporal continuum, and fate. As each soul fragment develops, another piece of the puzzle is unlocked and things get just a little more comprehensible.
